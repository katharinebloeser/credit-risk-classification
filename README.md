# credit-risk-classification
 
The purpose of this analysis is to predict "healthy" or low-risk loans and high-risk loans (i.e., those that default). The model predicted healthy loans best, with a precision score of 100% or 1.00. This suggests tehre were no false positives. In terms of recall, the model identifies 99% (recall = 0.99) of healthy loans. This means that only 1% of predictions of health loans were incorrect.

For predicting high-risk or loans likely to default, the model performed less well (precision = 0.89), 11% of the predictions for high-risk loans were false positives. This is still a fairly high precision rate. In terms of recall, the model predicting high-risk loans had a recall rate of 94% (recall = 0.94). This means that 6% of the positive predictions (i.e., a loan is high-risk) were incorrect.

Overall, the model predicted 99% of loans correctly. It is suggested that the bank use this model as there is low risk to falsely predicting high-risk loans, it just means a wealthy bank loses money.
